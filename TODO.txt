ideas for later:
    introduce a start screen

    introduce a end screen with ... player won

    introduce ai with different difficulty levels

    build a server and options to play with another person via network



Refactoring :
    - SelectTileListener.handleMovement and SelectTileListener.handleSelection are
      pretty unreadable.
    - Remove SelectTileListener.checkIfMoveIsLegal and SelectTileListener.checkIfJumpIsLegal duplicate code.
