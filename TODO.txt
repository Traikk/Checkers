further down the road:
    - determine how pieces beat others

ideas for later:
    introduce a start screen
    introduce a end screen with ... player won

    introduce ai with different difficulty levels(dont even try until you made everything else)


Refactoring:
    - SelectTileListener.handleMovement and SelectTileListener.handleSelection are
      pretty unreadable.
    - Remove SelectTileListener.checkIfMoveIsLegal duplicate if statements.
